Desk-side aviation weather at a glance. SkyGlance turns a
[Pimoroni Badger 2040 W](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/badger-2040-w)
into an always-on e-ink board that shows the current **METAR** for any
ICAO airport — temperature, flight category (`VFR` / `MVFR` / `IFR` / `LIFR`),
wind, visibility, cloud layers, and a 24-hour Zulu observation time.

The device talks directly to `aviationweather.gov` over HTTPS. **No server,
no API key, no account** — flash it, set your Wi-Fi SSID and an ICAO
identifier, and it runs.

## Display

```

- Big temp (Fahrenheit) top-left.
- Big flight category top-right.
- Last observation time (UTC / Zulu) in the corner.
- Station, visibility, wind, cloud layers below.
- `(offline)` marker in the bottom-right if the last fetch failed; the
  previous frame stays on-screen until the next successful refresh.

## Quick start

### 1. Clone and install host dev tools

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gndl00p/skyglance.git
cd skyglance

python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install pytest==8.3.3

.venv/bin/pytest tests -v      # 24 tests, fully offline
```

### 2. Configure the device

```bash
cp config.example.py config.py
# edit config.py:
#   WIFI_SSID        = "<your 2.4 GHz SSID>"
#   WIFI_PSK         = "<password>"
#   METAR_STATION    = "KLBB"   # any ICAO identifier
#   REFRESH_MINUTES  = 15
```

`config.py` is git-ignored — your Wi-Fi password never leaves the device.

### 3. Flash

```bash
bash tools/flash.sh
```

The script copies `main.py`, `fetcher.py`, `render.py`, `store.py`, and
`config.py` to the Pico, preserves any persisted `/state.json`, and
triggers a soft-reset.

## How it works

```
  +------------------------+          HTTPS          +------------------------+
  |  aviationweather.gov   |<------------------------| Badger 2040 W          |
  |  /api/data/metar       |                         | MicroPython firmware   |
  +------------------------+                         | Wi-Fi + e-ink panel    |
                                                     +------------------------+
```

- `main.py` boots, runs one fetch + render cycle, then loops every
  `REFRESH_MINUTES`. Button **A** forces an immediate refresh.
- `fetcher.py` connects Wi-Fi, hits `aviationweather.gov` over HTTPS,
  and parses the METAR JSON into a flat dict (temp °F, wind, clouds,
  visibility, ceiling, flight category).
- `render.py` paints the e-ink panel.
- `store.py` persists the last successful fetch in `/state.json` so
  the panel has something to show during Wi-Fi or API outages.
- On any error the previous frame stays, a small `(offline)` / `(bad payload)` marker appears, and the next refresh tries again.

Stable at ~5 KB of flash for the application plus the persisted state
file. No extra dependencies beyond what Pimoroni's stock MicroPython
build already ships (`badger2040`, `requests`, `network`, `ujson`).

## Flight category thresholds

| Category | Ceiling        | Visibility (SM) |
| -------- | -------------- | --------------- |
| **LIFR** | < 500 ft       | < 1             |
| **IFR**  | < 1 000 ft     | < 3             |
| **MVFR** | ≤ 3 000 ft     | ≤ 5             |
| **VFR**  | > 3 000 ft     | > 5             |

Evaluated top-to-bottom — a 700 ft ceiling wins over 10 SM visibility.

## Configuration (`config.py`)

| Field              | Purpose                                                      |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `WIFI_SSID`        | 2.4 GHz network the Pico W joins                             |
| `WIFI_PSK`         | Pre-shared key                                               |
| `METAR_STATION`    | ICAO airport identifier (`KLBB`, `KAUS`, `EGLL`, `YSSY`, …) |
| `REFRESH_MINUTES`  | How often to re-fetch. METARs update hourly — 15 is polite. |

## Buttons

| Button | Action               |
| ------ | -------------------- |
| A      | Force refresh        |
| B / C  | Reserved for future  |
| UP     | LED off              |
| DOWN   | `halt()` (LiPo only) |

## Repository layout

```
main.py            entry point — first cycle, then refresh loop
fetcher.py         Wi-Fi connect, HTTPS GET, METAR parser, stale fallback
render.py          e-ink layout
store.py           /state.json persistence (read/write)
config.example.py  template (copy to config.py, never committed)
tools/flash.sh     mpremote-based deploy + soft-reset

tests/             host-side pytest suite
  conftest.py        adds tests/stubs to sys.path
  stubs/             fake Pimoroni / MicroPython modules
  fakes/display.py   FakeDisplay that records draw calls
```

## Development

Run the suite:

```bash
.venv/bin/pytest tests -v
```

Everything is mocked — no real hardware, no network. The
`tests/stubs/` directory provides tiny fakes for `badger2040`,
`network`, `requests`, `machine`, and `ujson` so the modules that
import them at device boot still import cleanly on CPython.

To add a feature that calls a new Pimoroni API, extend the stub in
`tests/stubs/badger2040.py` with a no-op method — this keeps the
suite runnable on any machine without a device attached.

## Troubleshooting

### The panel shows `--F ----` indefinitely

Wi-Fi didn't connect. Verify SSID + PSK in `config.py`. Reset the
device; if the issue persists, run a scan:

```bash
mpremote connect /dev/ttyACM0 exec 'import network, time
w = network.WLAN(network.STA_IF); w.active(True); time.sleep(1)
for n in w.scan(): print(n[0], n[2], n[3])'
```

### E-ink shows solid black blocks

You flashed artwork from a previous version that used an inverted
dither polarity. If you're re-adding asset support, pack bit=1 for
black pixels — Pimoroni's `picographics.image()` draws set bits in
the current pen.

### Buttons don't respond after the first render

The firmware uses a polling idle loop specifically because
`display.halt()` on the Badger 2040 W is a no-op under USB power.
If buttons are still unresponsive, every `mpremote exec` ctrl-Cs
the running firmware — issue `mpremote connect /dev/ttyACM0 soft-reset`
to restart it.

### `ImportError: no module named 'state.load'`

The factory Pimoroni filesystem ships a `state/` directory for the
stock launcher; MicroPython resolves `import state` to that package
and shadows a `state.py` file. That's why the persistence module is
called `store.py` instead of `state.py`.

## Security notes

- `config.py` holds your Wi-Fi password and is git-ignored. Review
  `.gitignore` after any branch-switch rebase.
- The device only makes outbound HTTPS to `aviationweather.gov`. No
  inbound listeners, no telemetry, no analytics.
- Resetting the device via BOOTSEL + drag-drop the factory firmware
  clears everything; run `bash tools/flash.sh` to restore.

## Roadmap

- Optional second METAR tile (home / destination) with paged display.
- Battery-powered variant using `halt()` + `badger2040.pressed_to_wake`
  for multi-day LiPo runtime between refreshes.
- Visual alert when flight category degrades by two tiers in one cycle.
- Flash-minimising build (strip unused Pimoroni libs).
